// Installing the app and signing in, in one trip to github.com.
//
// A GitHub App has two separate grants and the editor needs both: authorization says who you are,
// installation is what lets a token write to a repository. They are asked for separately, because
// asking for them together only works once: github.com/apps/<slug>/installations/new completes and
// redirects on a first install, but for somebody who already installed the app it just shows the
// configure page and no code ever comes back. So this drives the authorize endpoint, which answers
// the same way whether or not the app is installed, and the editor sends people to the install page
// only when it finds the app missing from the repository they want to write to.
//
// The exchange needs the client secret, so the relay holds a credential. The authorize endpoint
// does accept PKCE, so the code is bound to this tab by a verifier it never leaves with, and by
// `state` on top. Everything after sign-in talks to api.github.com directly.
